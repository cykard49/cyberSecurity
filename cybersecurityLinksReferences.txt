- The State of Authentication Security is a report that you can have delivered to your email by clicking on the link below:
    https://www.cybersecurity-insiders.com/portfolio/2023-the-state-of-authentication-security-enzoic/ 

- This publication provides a catalog of security and privacy controls for information systems and organizations to protect organizational operations and 
assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation from a diverse set of threats and risks, including hostile attacks, 
human errors, natural disasters, structural failures, foreign intelligence entities, and privacy risks. 
The controls are flexible and customizable and implemented as part of an organization-wide process to manage risk.
The controls address diverse requirements derived from mission and business needs, laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines.
Finally, the consolidated control catalog addresses security and privacy from a functionality perspective 
(i.e., the strength of functions and mechanisms provided by the controls) and from an assurance perspective 
(i.e., the measure of confidence in the security or privacy capability provided by the controls).
Addressing functionality and assurance helps to ensure that information technology products and the systems that rely on those products are sufficiently trustworthy.

- The Biggest Data Security Breaches 
This article discusses the biggest data security breaches in the U.S.  We will be studying data breaches so it's good to review these. 
Make note of the ones that are of most interest to you.  You might select one or more from this list for your breach project. 
Note - the same data breach cannot be selected by students in this class.  Each breach reported on must be a different breach.

- Cybersecurity Framework - Most Popular Framework in Use Today! 
This framework is important to your learning in this class. 
You are being asked in the major class project to use the NIST framework 2.0 in your project.
The NIST Framework 2.0 was released February, 2024.  The URL is provided below:

- Data Classification Schemes:
The links below will provide examples of how data is classified in different industries:
  1) Energy Company Data Classification Model: https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/oeprod/DocumentsandMedia/21-Security_Framework_for_Data_Class.pdf 
  2) University Data Classification Scheme - it's important to understand data classification.
    You will want to make sure you discuss this control in your project.
    Most schools use similar classifications as well as most businesses.  
    Government may use a different classification scale.

 OSI Model Demystified

- In the link below you will be able to see a YouTube on understanding the OSI model.
  It is critical information and important to your understanding of networking.
  Everything in networking and data protection starts with at least a basic understanding of the OSI model.
